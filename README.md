# Mold-Game
 "Breaking the Mold". Made for UTD SGDA Spring 2024 Game Jam

Made from 3/6/2024 to 3/17/2024

# Branches
I'd like to request that we use the format "[name]-[feature]" for our branches.
For example if I was testing the speed of the grapple I'd use: "james-grapple-speed-test"

Try to not commit to main/master if your code doesn't fully working, or if you are doing play testing tweaks as we will most likely want a couple people to test changes before implementation.
